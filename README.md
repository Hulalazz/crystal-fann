# crystal-fann

Crystal bindings for the FANN C lib

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  crystal-fann:
    github: bararchy/crystal-fann
```

## Usage

Look at the spec for most functions

```crystal
require "crystal-fann"
ann = Crystal::Fann::Network.new(2, [2], 1)
500.times do
  ann.train_single([1.0_f32, 0.1_f32], [0.5_f32])
end
result = ann.run([1.0_f32, 0.1_f32])
# Remmber to close the network when done to free allocated C mem
ann.close
```

## Development

- [] Add TrainData class  
- [] Add network call method to train on train data  
- [] Add binding to the 'Parallel' binding to work on multi CPU at same time  
- [] Clean uneeded bindings in the LibFANN binding  
- [] Add specific Exceptions  

I guess more stuff will be added once more people will use it.
